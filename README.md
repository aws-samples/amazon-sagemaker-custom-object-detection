## Custom Object Detection, using Native AWS Services

This project demonstrates how you can set up a custom object detection model and track what objects where removed from a session. A session is a time window when a person is in the camera frame. This shows the basic building blocks for developing computer vision based services for tracking what things are present or not, especially when people are observed.
